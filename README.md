# bin
My personal bin directory.


## Pre-Set up
I use python3.7, so before running I install python3.7, then set
`alias python=python3.7` and `alias pip=pip3` in ~/.bash_profile.

## Set-up
Run `make` to connect this bin to your machine.
Open a new terminal or follow the instructions from the make command.
Run `personal_bin -v` to verify the connection.

The make run is idempotent as long as a new terminal is opened or the make instructions are followed.

## Additions
After adding any new files here, run `make executable` to be able to run it.
